                Hi, my name is Haim Azulay, I'm a Software Engineer from Braude College with a strong passion for information security.
                <br />
                I started my academic journey as a Practical Software Engineer at Braude and quickly realized my desire to specialize in cybersecurity.
                <br />
                Early in my software engineering studies, I took the initiative to enroll in a cyber and ethical hacking course at John Bryce College to deepen my knowledge in the field.
                <br />
                Today, I have over a year of hands-on experience as a Security Researcher, where Iâ€™ve been involved in analyzing threats, discovering vulnerabilities, and contributing to real-world security solutions.
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm now actively seeking new opportunities in the information security field.
                <br />
